To facilitate reading over the code at a later point, I will try to adhere to 
the following style guidelines.

ClassName: Names beginning with an upper case letter are class names.

Varname: variable names begin with a lower case letter.

_name: Names beginning with an underscore shouldn't be used outside the class
       they're declared in. This goes for functions as well as variable names.

Other style guidelines may pop up in the future, or not. We'll see.
